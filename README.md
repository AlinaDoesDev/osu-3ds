# osu!3ds
A (homebrew) port of osu! to the Nintendo 3DS.

# How to build
Assuming you have devkitPro already installed: Simply make a folder in "romfs" called "default", place an osu! skin in there WITHOUT "skin.ini" (I also recommend removing @2x textures) and then run "build.bat". If a command fails to execute after the build, you likely don't have Citra (Nintendo 3DS emulator) in your environment variables, however you can ignore this if your just testing on your Nintendo 3DS.
